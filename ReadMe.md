                Reflection of The Case Against Grades 


       I am from India back home grades are everything it has the power to decide a person future If you want to get into your dream school, dream job everything is related to grades the education system is messed up in India the standard of education is designed in a way that grads are awarded base on predetermined grading structure, not to those who have a different perspective.
  
       Creativity, logical thinking has no value in India. Everyone runs after the Grade or percentage they do not care about the knowledge. Grades are a way that is used to identify the understanding of the student in a particular subject and the ways they can improve themselves. I had a very bitter experience with the grading system in India during my undergraduate 

       I attended a Job fair it was my dream to work for Oracle my profile was rejected the particular reason for the circumstance was my percentage was 0.05 below the cut-off and the cut off was 75%  this incident changed my perspective about education I began to run after grades I did not focus on whether I was learning anything it was a dark time for me. In the eighth semester of my undergraduate course, we had to submit a final project we were instructed by our professor to improvise the existing source code so we did use stack overflow we did not learn anything that semester. It felt  I got my grades for showing up it was like getting a participation medal in a competition. There was no sense of accomplishment only guilt and shame.
        
         This all changed when I got my first job in a multinational corporation named Atos few days after joining the organization I realized that the corporate world was different.
         “ You either Pass or you learn” this is the motivation I will use to drive. I have decided not to repeat what happened in my undergraduate course. Yes, I have opted for an easy way to get a better grade to improve my performance and percentage. 

         I enrolled in a course that had no contribution to word my core concentration the entire course was easy the assignments were to do they have lots of references. Coming to the values to learn after removing the grades I have not taught about this. I want to learn and improve my self, skillset and apply it in the real world.

         Grading and the education system is a very disputable top out there. to sum up everything thing I have stated  so fare.I agree with Alfie Kohn  grading should not be the only factor.
